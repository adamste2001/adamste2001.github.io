    <H2>What is my Final Project about?</h2>
    
  
    <p>My final project is a valuable and practical resource for musicians of all ages. My program will transpose any given pitch, <br>whether it is concert or written pitch. My program will display the results for <strong>clarinet, saxophone, and french horn</strong> in a final output scene.</p> 
    
    <p>At the start of my program, there are two buttons to choose from. If the pitch you want to tranpose is in concert pitch then you select the concert pitch button. If the pitch you want to tranpose is written pitch, then you choose the written pitch button.</p>
    
    <p>From here you are brought to a circle of fifths, the very core of all music theory. This is where you will select a pitch! After the pitch is selected, the following scene will display the results in the keys for <strong>clarinet, saxophone, and french Horn</strong>.</p> 
    
    
    <p>If you are not familiar with transpositions, I will provide a brief overview.</p>
    
    <p>Instruments are all built to play in a different key, with the key of <i>'C'</i> being concert pitch. For example, <strong>clarinet</strong> is built to play in the key of <i>'Bb'</i>, <strong>saxophone</strong in the key of <i>'Eb'</i>, and <strong>french horn</strong> in the key of <i>'F'</i>.</p>
    
   <p>Typically, as musicians, we use concert pitch in group settings, and refer to all notes in concert pitch. It can be quite challenigng to do tranpositions in your head, especially going between written to concert and concert to written. This program will allow a user to quickly and easily input a given note and recieve the most common answers for an ensemble.</p>
