    <H2>What is my Final Project about?</h2>
    My final project is a valuable and practical resource for musicians. This program will transpose any given pitch, whether it is concert or written pitch. The program will always display the results for Clarinet, Saxophone, and French Horn. At the start of the program, there are two buttons to choose from. If the pitch you want to tranpose is in concert pitch then you select the concert pitch button. If the pitch you want to tranpose is written pitch, then you choose the written pitch button. From here you are brought to a circle of fifths, the very core of all music theory. This is where you will select a pitch! AFter the putch is selected the following screen will display the results in Clarinet, Saxophone, and French Horn. 
    
    If you are not familiar with transpositions, I will give a brief overview. Instruments are all built to play in a different key. For example, clarinet is built to play in the key of Bb, Saxophone in the key of Eb, and French Horn in the key of F. Concert pitch is in the key of C. Typically, as musicians, we will talk about concert pitch, and refer to all notes in concert pitch. It can be quite challenigng to do tranpositions in your head, especially going between written to concert and concert to written. This program will allow a user to quickly and easily input a given note and recieve the most common answers for an ensemble.
