   <H1> Hello and Welcome to My Programming Portfolio </h1>
    
    <H2>About this website</h2>
    This Website will serve as a portfolio for the culmination of all my work in CSC106. 
    Included will be exmaples of code that I have written and other such projects that will be counted toward my completion of the class.
    There will be a number of ways that you can navigate the website to reach each section, with each step being coded and done myself. 
    The hope is that by the end of the class this will be a fully flushed, smoothly working little website.
